PHP Collection contains 3 files and 2 links:
Compiler, ftplugin, script for use with 'keywordprg' and PHP
manual, links to vim dictionaries of PHP functions and prototypes.

I. PHP compiler (cphp.vim)
Requirements:
1. PHP compiled as cgi (or cli)
2. bash
3. grep compatible tool :help grep
4. standard message error from PHP (it doesn't use debugger) 
:help compiler
Help:
:make
Will parse the current file, and report errors (if any).

II. PHP ftplugin (php.vim)
Inspired by Christopher Swingley I add some things and put it in
ftplugin file.
First part is ``objective'' and contains only important(?) settings. In
second are some useful options commented by default.

III. Bash script for 'keywordprg' option. (phpmanual.sh)
Written by Leszek Krupinski <leszek@php.net> for use with K. 
Default settings points to lynx and directory where Mkd8.2 puts
php-manual rpm.

IV. Links. Both dictionaries where created by Leszek Krupinski
Dictionary of PHP functions:
http://www.leon.w-wa.pl/texts/phpfunclist
Dictionary of PHP prototypes:
http://www.leon.w-wa.pl/texts/phpproto

INSTALLATION:
1. Rename cphp.vim as php.vim and place it in
.vim/compiler/
2. Place it in
.vim/ftplugin/
3. Make script executable and place it in eg.
.vim/external/         (suggested in php.vim)
4. You could place dictionaries in eg.
.vim/dictionaries/     (suggested in php.vim)


Thanks for Doug Kearns, Leszek Krupinski and Christopher Swingley

to use php4's 'lint' filter, instead of executing a php file with 
a query string. A few comments added to phpmanual.sh
